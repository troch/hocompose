# hocompose

Using Higher-Order Components in React is great for composition: they allow to decouple rendering logic from component lifecycle.

However, you can quickly pile them up and they can slow down your application by multiplying the number of React component instances your application has to handle.

__hocompose__ allows you to compose behaviours together in only one higher-order component.
